## 10/20/2025 - 19-Oct (Idea And Design)  

(7AM-8AM)
The day when MAKZY was just a rough idea, Learned about how i can get more to CAD models and printers and realised i would need a companion for TOYZY , it will work on Ardiuno Mega and Ramp shield ,the Idea of this type 3D printer is not just one day thought it was my next target after highway but was not able to get started ,and was it was left ,thus got to that page where my idea could implemented ,so that was the story behind building this project
(10am-10:40)
thus as it was off from my school so i decided to do lot o work today itself so firts i created a basic structure of the printer in Fusion360

(11am-2PM)
after that it required to place on a stand so it took me a hour to create a perfect and unique stand for the printer as its my second time of a complex cad modeling which required a proper measurement so it was taking a lot of time

 Now it was time to create add vertical extrunsions so i created a mount for it and it was the hardest part because if it go wrong whole printer would not work properly so i created a mount and holes for it !![Screenshot (214).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5981dd81bfdec2cb6ca1b11996befcc27f2f14ef/Screenshot%20(214).png)
![Screenshot (215).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e25dd0904772a4e65f16b1fb0ff711cef52a27b9/Screenshot%20(215).png)

After that i realised that the orientation of the extrunsion was not good for the printer mechanics so quickly update the mount and positon of the rods to get to right position![Screenshot (216).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a117bdc8f70c7d916cd434908938f5a136eb7f03/Screenshot%20(216).png)

after this i add wheels and mount for nema motors ![Screenshot (219).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1114fb0d3d6a61076727b9707a6dfb2ba5dacd2e/Screenshot%20(219).png)

## 10/22/2025 6:08 PM - 20-Oct (Idea And Design Continue)   

uhh i hate typing in my small laptop so i just keep on the journal with writting it physically on my fav notebook this process is same as i did for highway and clutter so yeah please forgive me for late journaling ,

(8am-9am ,20 oct )
so today i decided to complete gantry and for that i would need holder for motor on one side and another side for pully hmm so after making many diff styles a perfect look was not coming so saw many printers and decided to make now as i wanted to to be functionally good and lookwise also so here what i made

 ![Screenshot (236).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--67159f61cd8d001e96774fdacecf1f447d761449/Screenshot%20(236).png)
![Screenshot (235).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4b0b8867b13aaadacd8419484c779ddd94a5be3b/Screenshot%20(235).png)

(10am-1am ,20 oct ) 
after that i started making toolhead holder for the printer it would look good as well as practical because the toolhead of TOYZY is very heavy so i decide to add only one fan uff challenges occur again my laptop is running very slow the thing which req to make is taking more time than need ,hmm nvm i will do everything for this printer ,and add a slot for fan to placed vertically and a hole for the fan to cool hot end , for this printer i looking to use same e3d hot end ,i let the other side open for wires hmm also it will be moving on the wheels and aluminium extrunsion her it how it looks like all this i will be add to the main model for a final look of the day

hmm after a 10 min break i decided to add belts to it the uhh it really took me half and hour to set it up along the line because my lap was not able the handle the load i used patteren along path to make the bellt it took 30 min to render a belt for one side and after 2 hour i was able to complete the belt and yeah fter 3o min i fully setuped the gantry here it looks

## 10/22/2025 6:14 PM - 21 Oct Electronics Part   

Electronics was a work of 30 min for me as i knew how would i connect wires bcz after a exp of printer which i made ,hmm i would be using marlin and ardiuno and ramps combo for this i have a room for bl touch wiil look to add if i had time so starting with the Motors i connected the and Yaxis motor to the motorpins and then connected two X axis motorin parrallel and then connected to the board next connected Two Z axis Motors to the Board then connected Hot bed and Extruter Thermistors,Then 2 fans With power supply and and 1 for Heatsink ,moving to lcd display i choose a 3.5 inch tft touch diplay a connceted to the EXp1 And Exp2 the connected hotend and heat bed to th board , as There were many thing connected to a single board so the wiring looks very complex but trust me i have assinged diff color to diff wires so try to zoom the pic for more understanding ,tried to make it more cleaner but coudnt i will be using Marlin As Firmware and Will try to create my custom and personalised one in future

## 10/22/2025 6:37 PM - 22 Oct (Design Continue)  

so yesterday i was not able to complete my full model bcz of our traditional festival so yeah today my goal was to make y axis for that i first started with creating a bed holder for hot bed and yeah i decided to make a it m shape but fully functionable it took me 40 min to create a bed holder after sketch on my lap uhh i would def throw this piece of trash after i comp this project 

![Screenshot (231).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--de0b248eb53f1ec250f3317d46c2d02947a2cc17/Screenshot%20(231).png)
![Screenshot (232).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM3NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c2e7e2dc6676dba99746a527cab04086b17498fe/Screenshot%20(232).png)

after this i created a holder for y axis extrunsion and a mount for motor for this it was a complicate das motor was to be placed stabl nd steady it would screw upto the profile and then a ock system to make it fullt float 

![Screenshot (233).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--80716671e77699f6a304ecbd86612fdb88d574b4/Screenshot%20(233).png)
 
then second side i added a pully to hold the belt and uhh it was time to do the most anoying part of this project the belts i repeated the same staep and tried to add allin once but it took 40 min to fully added and then for athor side which took 24 min ig idk why its talikg to long may be due to my bad ram which i tried to replace for more power and yeah it does but opp ,movng to the belt it took maybe 1-1.5 hour idk the exact time to load and here how it looks like![Screenshot (226).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fff71c426a1e5fd48d108e26e7285b99a599548a/Screenshot%20(226).png)

 hmm after some finishing touches i was able to complete it and yeah see how it looks
