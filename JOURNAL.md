## 10/20/2025 - 19-Oct (Idea And Design)  

(7AM-8AM)
The day when MAKZY was just a rough idea, Learned about how i can get more to CAD models and printers and realised i would need a companion for TOYZY , it will work on Ardiuno Mega and Ramp shield ,the Idea of this type 3D printer is not just one day thought it was my next target after highway but was not able to get started ,and was it was left ,thus got to that page where my idea could implemented ,so that was the story behind building this project
(10am-10:40)
thus as it was off from my school so i decided to do lot o work today itself so firts i created a basic structure of the printer in Fusion360

(11am-2PM)
after that it required to place on a stand so it took me a hour to create a perfect and unique stand for the printer as its my second time of a complex cad modeling which required a proper measurement so it was taking a lot of time

 Now it was time to create add vertical extrunsions so i created a mount for it and it was the hardest part because if it go wrong whole printer would not work properly so i created a mount and holes for it !![Screenshot (214).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5981dd81bfdec2cb6ca1b11996befcc27f2f14ef/Screenshot%20(214).png)

After that i realised that the orientation of the extrunsion was not good for the printer mechanics so quickly update the mount and positon of the rods to get to right position![Screenshot (216).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a117bdc8f70c7d916cd434908938f5a136eb7f03/Screenshot%20(216).png)

after this i add wheels and mount for nema motors ![Screenshot (219).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1114fb0d3d6a61076727b9707a6dfb2ba5dacd2e/Screenshot%20(219).png)
