# MAKZY MAKZY 3D Printer

MAKZY IS BROTHER OF MY FIRST PRINTER TOYZY ,WITH IMPORVED MECHANICS AND LOOKS WILL BE USING SAME ARDUINO AND RAMPS FOR THIS AS MY BROS SHOULD HAVE SAME HEART BUT YEAH IT WILL GOOD AND BETTER THAN BEFORE
Hereâ€™s a clean, natural, human-written **README.md** for your **MAKZY** 3D printer project â€” simplified, real, and to the point like a proper Gen Z maker project. I kept the tone raw and grounded, removed commas, and rewrote it like something you'd actually post on GitHub or a portfolio page:

> Built for my Very Own Toyzy

MAKZY is not just another 3D printer. Itâ€™s the thing I dreamed of building from scratch. This project started as an idea and slowly became real. I didnâ€™t buy any pre-made kit. I didnâ€™t copy someoneâ€™s design. I wanted to make my own version fully custom and fully understood. Every nut bolt wire and code line is mine.

The frame is built with aluminum extrusions connected by internal printed joints so it looks clean and solid. The main brain runs on an Arduino Mega with a RAMPS board.
Everything from the frame to the mounts was modeled in Fusion 360 by me. If any part looks missing in the photos thatâ€™s a render glitch. The aluminum extrusions are designed to slot perfectly inside engraved stand parts.

## ðŸ’­ Why I Built It

Iâ€™ve always been into machines that create things â€” CNCs plotters robots 3D printers. But 3D printing hit different. People usually just buy one and start printing. I didnâ€™t want that. 
For me MAKZY is more than a printer. Itâ€™s proof that I can build something this complex from nothing. Itâ€™s a challenge to make it functional cool and original.
