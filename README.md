# MAKZY 3D Printer
---
Makzy is the second version of the Toyzy the 3d printer it has better looks and design and even better functioning , making it more compact and fast i have used upper version of ramp for it and toyzy works good but it gets stopped working in between due to bad mounting of the parts so it needs to screwed up to get it working but yeah i wont be facing problem with this ,every single part of this made by doing proper test in real life like i have tested out shapes for the functionality 

##  Why I Built It

since  i made my first printer i was not fully satisfied bcz it had some cons yeah i know this version may also have some problem with it but i would keep the process on going for making printer untill i get a perfect commercial level diy 3d printer bcz i want it be work globally and launch in market by which anyone can get a diy 3d printer therefore i would like thank to bluprint for a great platform to get out my atmost potential

## How You can Make it
yeah it requires many diff steps to make a 3d printer but you can make one using my provide parts and models and just assemble them or just mail me out for any help bcz i am free all the time
